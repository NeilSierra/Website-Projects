      <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
      <p>
        Table tennis, also known as ping pong, is a dynamic and fast-paced sport enjoyed by millions worldwide. Originating in England in the
        late 19th century, it has grown into an internationally beloved game, especially popular in countries like China, Japan, and Germany.
        The game's appeal lies in its accessibility: it can be played at various skill levels, making it suitable for all ages. Table tennis
        combines reflexes, strategy, and precision, as players rally back and forth at high speeds, often in mere fractions of a second. Its
        popularity stems from the low cost of equipment, compact playing space, and the potential for fun or intense competition, making it a
        truly universal sport.
