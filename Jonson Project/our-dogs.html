              Tiki remained a sweet, loving dog all throughout his ordeal -where he was only given scraps for food and drank rain water from a puddle near his chained area. When he was rescued, he wagged his tail non-stop and was very excited to get into the vehicle that would take him to the PAWS shelter. Tiki holds no grudges and wants to be friends with everyone he meets for the first time.

              When Haley, a hit and run victim, was found underneath a parked car, the PAWS rescuers were unsure if she would make it. After being treated for her injuries, the shelter vet was unsure if she would walk again. Well, Haley put all our uncertainties to rest by bouncing back and being one of the friendliest dogs at the shelter. We’re SURE that she’ll make the best canine companion ever!
